i like experimenting with ai. i like building things that last, (not some new gpt wrapper to get into yc 😭). experimenting with research-based approoach to singulate memory for ai agents.  

i also heavily enjoy my time with frontend dev.

- building mesh-based wifi for ([amazon](https://eero.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorXKetLSIMUrt76wCdY6sUanFWL4lLyK9n_whEMiSInHu-HnMVc)) 
- built agentic tools + canvas-based ux for video editing at [mosaic (yc 25)](https://mosaic.so/)

- optimizing embedded systems (apis and scheduling) for [flagship products](https://www.idexx.com/en/veterinary/analyzers/catalyst-one-chemistry-analyzer/) at [idexx](https://www.idexx.com/en/)
